          <p> My name is Akash Seelam and I am a freshman at Dublin High School. 
          I am aspiring, as my ultimate goal, to be a marine biologist. To reach 
          this goal, I would like to attend the University of Marine Biology in Hawaii. 
          In this letter, I would like to  tell you a little bit about myself. I 
          am a hard worker, can be a group leader or work alone, and will always 
          get an amazing project in before the deadline. I am a multipotentialite, 
          and have experience in a variety of fields. A few things about me: I play
          sports, I like to hike, swim, and study.I am a perfectionist, as one time
          in 8th grade, the most important project of the year, which took up the 
          majority of our second semester, was looming. Our group was mediocre, 
          even though we were all friends.Our group squabbled, argued, and fought 
          over the smallest things, as who gets to write their name first on the 
          board. The board was a disaster. I tried reasoning with my teammates, but
          they insisted they will get it done. In the last week, I was finished with
          the bickering. I went up to ask my teacher to switch groups, and I was 
          unfortunate not to have done it sooner. In the last three days, I finished
          the project (Starting from scratch) that was supposed to be done by six 
          people over the course of three months. Later, I got my grade back from 
          my teacher. It was an A. My former group got a C-. This shows that while 
          I can work hard, can get good work done in a short amount of time, and 
          I can  make good choices for my education, as I left my friends for a 
          better grade. However, I can work in a group very well too. In 7th grade,
          we had a similar project. However, I was put in a team with responsible 
          individuals, and we worked day and night. We quite literally outshone all 
          the competition. We presented, and our teacher was amazed that 5 seventh 
          graders came up with a product so organized and well-presented. Our project
          was so good that she insisted she keep it as an example of a perfect project.
          On that project, we got a 110 percent. We got extra credit for how good the 
          project was, and we were in the spotlight. I love to work on something that 
          I like to do. I am responsible, hardworking, and also a team player, things 
          that are important in the world we have today. I always pursue what I love
          to the fullest extent, as I am curious and what to learn more about the
          world I live in. I can make smart choices for my future even when I am 
          potentially risking a friendship.Thank you for your time.
