          <p> My name is Akash Seelam and I am a freshman at Dublin High School. 
          I am aspiring, as my ultimate goal, to be a marine biologist. To reach 
          this goal, I would like to attend the University of Marine Biology in Hawaii. 
          In this letter, I would like to  tell you a little bit about myself. I 
          am a hard worker, can be a group leader or work alone, and will always 
          get an amazing project in before the deadline. I am a multipotentialite, 
          and have experience in a variety of fields. A few things about me: I play
          sports, I like to hike, swim, and read. I am also a perfectionist, as one time
          in 8th grade, the most important project of the year, which took up the 
          majority of our second semester, was looming. Our group was mediocre, 
          even though we were all friends. Our group squabbled, argued, and fought 
          over the smallest things, as who gets to write their name first on the 
          board. The board was a disaster. It was very hard, but I finally convinced my
          teammates to work together instead of arguing. Once all the differences were
          set aside, we did extremely well. We quite literally outshone all 
          the competition. We presented, and our teacher was amazed that 5 eighth 
          graders came up with a product so organized and well-presented. Our project
          was so good that she insisted she keeps it as an example of a perfect project.
          On that project, we got a 110 percent. We got extra credit for how  the 
          project was, and we were in the spotlight. I love to work on something that 
          I like to do. I am responsible, hardworking, and also a team player, things 
          that are important in the world we have today. I always pursue what I love
          to the fullest extent, as I am curious and what to learn more about the
          world I live in. I will always make good choices for my education, and will
          try to work out problems, with the best of my ability. Thank you for your time.
